ABOUT CALCULATORS: 
A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator.
Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use exponents (or powers or indices) and trigonometry functions.

 
 
 
 
         LIBRARIES USED: 
 
• tkinter:-  python offers multiple options for developing GUI(Graphical user interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI application. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task. 
 
 
To create a tkinter app: 
 
importing the module – tkinter  
create the main window(container) 
add any number of widgets to the main window  
apply the event trigger on the widgets.  
 
 
        Implementation  
 
 
Python provides a data structure called dictionary which stores information in the form of key value pairs which is very convenient for implementing a cipher such as a morse code. We can save the morse code chart in a dictionary.  
 
The English character takes the place of key and the cipher text forms the value of corresponding keys.  
 
The values of keys can be accessed from the dictionary in the same way we access the value of array through their index and vice versa
